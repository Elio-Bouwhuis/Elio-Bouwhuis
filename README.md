# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elio Bouwhuis, and I am a game designer in the making. Besides doing some designing tasks for my projects, I also have some experiences with web and game development. I currently study Creative Media & Game Technologies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences in Enschede.
