# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elio Bouwhuis, and I am a game designer in the making. Besides doing designing tasks for my projects, I also have some experiences with web and game programming. You can find some of my projects under the "My projects" header further down this page. I currently study Creative Media & Game Technologies at Saxion University of Applied Sciences in Enschede. Before I attended this study I studied Game Developer at Aventus in Apeldoorn.
